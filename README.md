# ptx-abc-music-notation (- beta)

A extension for Micro:bit to play music in easy way (=ABC music notation).
ABC notation is a shorthand form of musical notation. In basic form it uses the letters A through G. The letter z is for a rest. Middle C is "C", C above one octave from middle C is "c", lower octaves are reached by using commas and higher octaves are written using apostrophes, e.g. ",C",  ",,C", "'c", "''c", and so on. The symbols "^", "_", and "=" are used to a sharp, flat or natural. e.g. "^C", ",_C", and so on. Unit length is set in the L field. The length of each note is defined by how many times the unit length. The letter "/" means "1/2", "//" means "1/4". Each notes are separeted with a space. 
For example(in key:C):
"A a3/2 e/ e f e2 z c f3/2 e/ e c A2 z"
